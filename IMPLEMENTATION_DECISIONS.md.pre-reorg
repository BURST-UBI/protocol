## 1. Implementation Order & MVP Scope

### 1.1 What is the MVP?
What's the minimum set of features to call it a working prototype? My suggested order:

1. `types` + `crypto` (foundation — everything depends on these)
2. `brn` (BRN computation — core of the protocol)
3. `trst` + merger graph (TRST lifecycle)
4. `transactions` (all tx types, validation)
5. `store` + `store_lmdb` (persistence)
6. `ledger` (DAG block-lattice)
7. `work` (anti-spam PoW)
8. `consensus` (double-spend resolution)
9. `verification` (endorsers, verifiers, challenges)
10. `vrf` (drand client — Phase 1 only)
11. `governance` + `consti`
12. `messages` + `protocol` + `network` (P2P)
13. `node` + `daemon` (orchestration)
14. `rpc` + `websocket` (APIs)
15. `wallet_core`
16. `groups`

**Does this order work, or do you want to reshuffle?**

Your answer:

### 1.2 Should the MVP include networking (P2P), or start as a single-node local prototype?
- **(a) Single-node first** — get all engines working locally, add networking later
- (b) Multi-node from the start — build networking alongside core

Your answer:

### 1.3 Should the MVP include governance, or defer it?
- (a) Include governance in MVP
- **(b) Defer governance** — hardcode initial parameters, add governance later

Your answer:

## 2. Cryptography & Addressing

### 2.1 Key generation: from seed or raw?
- **(a) BIP39 mnemonic** (24-word recovery phrase) → derive Ed25519 keypair. User-friendly, standard.
- (b) Raw Ed25519 keypair generation (no mnemonic). Simpler but no recovery phrase.
- (c) Both — support mnemonic but also allow raw key import.

Your answer:

### 2.2 Address encoding
The whitepaper says `brst_` prefix. What encoding for the public key portion?
- (a) Base32 (like Nano's `nano_` addresses) — e.g., `brst_1a2b3c4d...`
- **(b) Base58Check** (like Bitcoin) — e.g., `brst_5HueCGU8rMjxEXxiPuD5BDku4MkFqeZyd4dZ1jvhTVqvbTLvyTJ`
- (c) Hex — e.g., `brst_0x1a2b3c4d...`
- (d) Something else

Your answer:

### 2.3 Hash function output size
Blake2b supports variable output. Nano uses 256-bit (32 bytes).
- **(a) 256-bit / 32 bytes** (same as Nano)
- (b) 512-bit / 64 bytes

Your answer:

---

## 3. BRN Engine

### 3.1 Time precision
BRN accrual is a function of time. What precision?
- (a) Seconds (Unix timestamp) — **default**
- (b) Milliseconds
- (c) Ticks (abstract unit, not wall-clock)

Your answer:

### 3.2 BRN amount representation
How to represent BRN amounts internally?
- **(a) u128 integer** representing the smallest unit (like satoshis or raw in Nano). Define a "raw" unit where e.g. 1 BRN = 10^18 raw.
- (b) f64 floating point
- (c) Fixed-point decimal (e.g., rust_decimal)

Your answer:

### 3.3 Initial BRN accrual rate (launch default)
The whitepaper says this is democratically adjustable. But what's the starting value?
- Suggestion: **1 BRN per hour per verified wallet** (= 24 BRN/day). This is just a placeholder — governance can change it.
- Or specify your preferred rate:

Your answer:

### 3.4 Does BRN accrual start from verification time, or from a global epoch?
The whitepaper says `verified_at`. Just confirming:
- **(a) From the moment the wallet is verified** (each wallet has different start time)
- (b) From a global epoch (all wallets accrue from the same start time, but only after verification)

Your answer:

---

## 4. TRST & Merger Graph

### 4.1 TRST amount representation
Same as BRN? Or different?
- **(a) Same as BRN** — u128 raw units, 1 TRST = 10^18 raw
- (b) Different scale

Your answer:

### 4.2 Default TRST expiry period (launch default)
The whitepaper discusses everything from days to 200 years. The bootstrapping path suggests starting as "normal money" (infinite expiry). What's the launch default?
- **(a) Infinite (no expiry)** — launch as normal money, governance enables expiry later
- (b) 100 years
- (c) 50 years
- (d) Other:

Your answer:

### 4.3 TRST token ID generation
What uniquely identifies a TRST token?
- **(a) The hash of the transaction that created/split/merged it** (the tx hash IS the token ID)
- (b) Separate UUID
- (c) Sequential counter

Your answer:

### 4.4 Merger graph storage
- **(a) On-disk in LMDB** (persistent, survives restarts)
- (b) In-memory only (rebuilt from ledger on startup)

Your answer:

### 4.5 When TRST is split, do we create "change" automatically?
Example: Alice has 100 TRST and wants to send 30 to Bob.
- **(a) Two outputs**: 30 to Bob + 70 change back to Alice (UTXO-style)
- (b) Balance decremented: Alice's token goes from 100 to 70, Bob gets a new 30 token (account-balance-style)

Your answer:

---

## 5. Transaction Architecture

### 5.1 Transaction model: UTXO-like or account-balance?
Nano uses account-balance (each block updates the account's running balance). UTXO tracks individual "coins."
- **(a) Account-balance model** (like Nano) — each state block has the account's new balance. Simpler.
- (b) UTXO model — track individual TRST tokens as unspent outputs. More complex but natural for TRST's per-token metadata.
- (c) Hybrid — account balances for BRN (computed anyway), UTXO for TRST (because each token has unique origin/expiry)

Your answer:

### 5.2 Transaction encoding (on-disk and on-wire)
- (a) JSON — human readable, larger
- **(b) Bincode** — compact binary, fast, Rust-native
- (c) Protocol Buffers (protobuf) — cross-language, schema evolution
- (d) MessagePack — compact, cross-language
- (e) Custom binary (like Nano)

Your answer:

### 5.3 Send/Receive: one-phase or two-phase?
Nano uses two-phase: sender publishes a "send" block, recipient publishes a "receive" block. The TRST sits as "pending" in between.
- **(a) Two-phase** (like Nano) — sender sends, receiver must explicitly accept. Allows receiver to reject TRST (important for the fungibility trade-off — receivers may not want TRST from unknown origins).
- (b) One-phase — send is instant, receiver gets it immediately with no opt-in.

Your answer:

### 5.4 Burn transaction: does the receiver need to accept?
When Alice burns BRN and Bob receives freshly minted TRST:
- **(a) Two-phase** — Bob must publish a receive block (consistent with send model)
- (b) One-phase — TRST appears in Bob's account immediately (since it's freshly minted, there's no origin risk)

Your answer:

---

## 6. DAG / Ledger

### 6.1 State block format
Nano's state block has: account, previous, representative, balance, link, signature, work.
BURST needs additional fields. Which of these go IN the state block vs. being derived?

In-block fields I'm proposing:
- `account` (wallet address)
- `previous` (hash of previous block in this account's chain, zero for open block)
- `representative` (for ORV consensus)
- `balance_brn_burned` (cumulative BRN burned — BRN balance is derived)
- `balance_trst` (current TRST balance — or omit if UTXO)
- `link` (context-dependent: send destination, receive source, burn receiver, etc.)
- `origin` (for TRST transactions — hash of original burn tx)
- `block_type` (enum: Open, Burn, Send, Receive, Merge, Split, Endorse, Challenge, Vote, Delegate, ChangeRep)
- `signature`
- `work` (anti-spam PoW)
- `timestamp`

**Any fields to add or remove?**

Your answer:

### 6.2 Genesis block
The very first block in the entire network. What does it contain?
- **(a) A special genesis block** created by the protocol creator, containing initial parameters and the creator's wallet as the first verified wallet.
- (b) No special genesis — the creator's wallet open block is just a normal open block with the first endorsement.

Your answer:

### 6.3 Ledger pruning: when to prune?
- **(a) Configurable** — node operator sets pruning policy (e.g., prune expired TRST older than X days)
- (b) Automatic — prune as soon as TRST expires
- (c) Manual — only prune on explicit command

Your answer:

---

## 7. Consensus (Double-Spend Resolution)

### 7.1 Voting weight for ORV
Nano uses balance-weighted voting. BURST's governance is one-wallet-one-vote. What about consensus (double-spend resolution)?
- (a) One-wallet-one-vote (consistent with governance)
- **(b) Balance-weighted** (representatives with more delegated accounts have more weight, like Nano — better for fast consensus)
- (c) Hybrid — balance-weighted for consensus, one-wallet-one-vote for governance

Your answer:

### 7.2 Confirmation threshold
- **(a) 67%** of online voting weight (same as Nano)
- (b) Higher (e.g., 80%)
- (c) Configurable via governance

Your answer:

### 7.3 Default representative
When a wallet doesn't explicitly set a representative:
- **(a) Self-representative** (the wallet represents itself, like Nano)
- (b) Protocol-assigned default representative

Your answer:

---

## 8. Verification System

### 8.1 Initial parameter defaults (before governance exists)

| Parameter | Suggested Default | Your Value |
|---|---|---|
| Endorsement threshold (how many endorsers needed) | **3 endorsers** | |
| BRN burned per endorsement | **10 BRN** (10 hours of accrual) | |
| Number of verifiers selected | **7 verifiers** | |
| Verification threshold | **90% (6 out of 7)** | |
| Verifier BRN stake amount | **20 BRN** | |
| Maximum revotes | **3** | |
| Challenge stake amount | **50 BRN** | |
| Challenge reward (TRST) | **100 TRST** (or: proportional to revoked amount?) | |

Your answers (fill in the table or write "defaults"):

### 8.2 Genesis set
How many initial wallets does the creator endorse directly?
- **(a) Just the creator's wallet** — and they manually endorse the first few people
- (b) A small genesis set (e.g., 10-50 wallets of known people)
- (c) Other:

Your answer:

### 8.3 "Neither" vote penalty
The whitepaper says voting Neither excessively incurs penalties. What's the threshold?
- **(a) Penalty after voting Neither on more than 50% of assigned verifications** in a rolling window
- (b) Flat penalty per Neither vote
- (c) Decide later

Your answer:

---

## 9. VRF

### 9.1 Phase 1 drand configuration
- Default relay URL: **`https://api.drand.sh`**
- Default chain hash: **`8990e7a9aaed2ffed73dbd7092123d6f289930540d7651336225dc172e51b2ce`** (mainnet unchained)
- **Good?** Or use quicknet/testnet for dev?

Your answer:

### 9.2 Verifier selection algorithm
Given a random seed from VRF and a pool of eligible verifiers, how to select N?
- **(a) Hash(seed || verifier_address) — sort by hash, take top N** (deterministic, verifiable)
- (b) Weighted random sampling
- (c) Other:

Your answer:

---

## 10. Anti-Spam (Proof of Work)

### 10.1 PoW algorithm
- **(a) Blake2b nonce search** (like Nano — find nonce where Blake2b(nonce || block_hash) has N leading zeros)
- (b) Argon2 (memory-hard)
- (c) Other:

Your answer:

### 10.2 PoW difficulty
- **(a) Same as Nano's current difficulty** (fffffff800000000 threshold)
- (b) Lower (easier — faster transactions)
- (c) Configurable via governance
- (d) Adaptive (based on network load)

Your answer:

---

## 11. Governance

### 11.1 Initial governance parameters

| Parameter | Suggested Default | Your Value |
|---|---|---|
| Proposal endorsement cost | **100 BRN** | |
| Proposal window duration | **1 week** | |
| Voting window duration | **2 weeks** | |
| Cooldown duration | **1 week** | |
| Parameter supermajority | **80%** | |
| Consti supermajority | **90%** | |
| Quorum (% of verified wallets that must vote) | **30%** | |

Your answers:

### 11.2 Which parameters are governable at launch?
- **(a) All of them** — BRN rate, TRST expiry, verification thresholds, governance thresholds themselves
- (b) Only economic parameters (BRN rate, TRST expiry) — defer governance meta-parameters
- (c) Other subset:

Your answer:

---

## 12. Networking

### 12.1 P2P library
- (a) Roll our own TCP (like RsNano)
- **(b) Use rust-libp2p** — battle-tested, provides gossipsub, Kademlia, QUIC, hole-punching
- (c) Decide later

Your answer:

### 12.2 Default ports

| Service | Suggested Port |
|---|---|
| P2P | **7075** (same as Nano) or **7175** |
| RPC | **7076** or **7176** |
| WebSocket | **7078** or **7178** |

Your answer:

### 12.3 Message format (on-wire between nodes)
- (a) Bincode
- **(b) Protobuf** (better for cross-language compatibility and schema evolution)
- (c) Custom binary (like Nano)

Your answer:

---

## 13. Storage

### 13.1 LMDB database layout
How many named databases within the LMDB environment?

Proposed:
- `accounts` — wallet address → account info (verification status, representative, balance, block count)
- `blocks` — block hash → block data
- `pending` — (destination, source_hash) → pending receive info
- `frontiers` — wallet address → latest block hash
- `merger_graph` — origin hash → list of merge references
- `verification` — wallet address → verification state
- `governance` — proposal hash → proposal state
- `consti` — amendment hash → amendment state
- `meta` — protocol parameters, node config

**Any to add or remove?**

Your answer:

### 13.2 LMDB map size (max database size)
- **(a) 1 GB** for dev/testing
- (b) 128 GB for production
- (c) Configurable via node config

Your answer:

---

## 14. Wallet

### 14.1 Key storage
- **(a) Encrypted keystore file** (password-protected JSON, like Ethereum keystores)
- (b) Plain PEM files (like the current Python prototype)
- (c) Both

Your answer:

### 14.2 Wallet auto-merge behavior
The whitepaper says wallets auto-merge TRST with similar expiry dates. How aggressive?
- **(a) Merge tokens with expiry dates within 10% of each other** (e.g., tokens expiring between 90-100 days are merged)
- (b) Never auto-merge (user controls all merges)
- (c) Merge everything (single TRST balance, earliest expiry wins)

Your answer:

---

## 15. General

### 15.1 Logging level default
- **(a) Info** for release, Debug for dev
- (b) Warn for release
- (c) Configurable only

Your answer:

### 15.2 Config file format
- (a) TOML (Rust ecosystem standard)
- (b) JSON
- **(c) TOML for node config, JSON for RPC communication**

Your answer:

### 15.3 Test strategy
- **(a) Unit tests per crate + integration tests in node/** — use nullables for unit tests
- (b) Only integration tests
- (c) Other:

Your answer:

### 15.4 CI/CD
- **(a) GitHub Actions** (cargo check, cargo test, cargo clippy, cargo fmt)
- (b) Other
- (c) Decide later

Your answer:

---

## 16. Open Design Questions

These are bigger questions where I genuinely don't know the "right" answer:

### 16.1 Privacy: should TRST amounts be visible in transactions?
The whitepaper acknowledges zero financial privacy. For MVP:
- **(a) Full transparency** — all amounts visible (ship now, add ZKP later)
- (b) Explore partial privacy from the start

Your answer:

### 16.2 What happens to BRN of unverified/revoked wallets?
The whitepaper says BRN accrual stops. But what about accumulated BRN?
- **(a) Frozen** — BRN remains but can't be used (wallet is locked)
- (b) Destroyed — BRN balance resets to zero
- (c) Other:

Your answer:

### 16.3 Can a revoked wallet ever be re-verified?
- (a) Never — permanently banned
- **(b) Yes** — must go through full verification again from scratch (new endorsements, new verifiers)
- (c) Decide via Consti

Your answer:

### 16.4 Cross-chain / interop considerations?
Worth thinking about now, or pure future work?
- **(a) Ignore for now** — no bridges, no wrapped tokens
- (b) Design bridge-compatible transaction format from the start

Your answer:

---

## 17. TRST Edge Cases & Detailed Behavior

### 17.1 Can you send TRST to an unverified wallet?
- (a) No — only verified wallets can receive TRST
- **(b) Yes** — anyone can receive, but only verified wallets can send/burn
- (c) Other:

Your answer:

### 17.2 Can you send TRST to yourself?
Needed for explicit merge/split operations.
- **(a) Yes** — self-sends are valid (used for merge/split/reorganization)
- (b) No — merge/split are special transaction types, not self-sends

Your answer:

### 17.3 Can expired TRST be merged or split?
- (a) No — expired TRST is completely frozen (can't do anything with it)
- **(b) Merge only** — you can consolidate expired tokens for cleaner bookkeeping, but can't split
- (c) Both merge and split are allowed on expired TRST (still non-transferable to others though)

Your answer:

### 17.4 When governance changes the TRST expiry period, what happens to existing tokens?
- **(a) Only new TRST** — tokens already minted keep their original expiry
- (b) All TRST — existing tokens are retroactively updated to the new expiry
- (c) Hybrid — existing tokens get the longer of (original expiry, new expiry), never shortened

Your answer:

### 17.5 Minimum transfer amount?
- **(a) 1 raw** (the smallest representable unit — no minimum beyond that)
- (b) Higher minimum (e.g., 1000 raw) to prevent dust attacks
- (c) Configurable via governance

Your answer:

### 17.6 Minimum burn amount?
- **(a) 1 raw** (same as transfer)
- (b) Higher minimum (e.g., 1 BRN = 10^18 raw)
- (c) Configurable via governance

Your answer:

### 17.7 Maximum tokens per merge operation?
- (a) No limit
- **(b) 256 tokens per merge** (prevents excessively large transactions)
- (c) Other:

Your answer:

### 17.8 TRST value demurrage curve
How does TRST's market value decline as it approaches expiry? The protocol doesn't enforce this (market does), but the wallet software needs a reference curve for display and pricing suggestions.
- **(a) Linear** — value decreases linearly from 100% at mint to 0% at expiry
- (b) Exponential decay — faster decline near expiry
- (c) Step function — full value until X% of lifetime, then drops
- (d) No reference curve — leave entirely to market/third parties

Your answer:

### 17.9 What happens to TRST held by a wallet that gets revoked (the holder, not the originator)?
The whitepaper covers originator revocation. But if the HOLDER's wallet is revoked:
- **(a) TRST they hold is frozen** — can't send it, but it's not revoked (the originator was legit)
- (b) TRST is returned to senders somehow
- (c) TRST is destroyed
- (d) TRST remains valid and can be claimed by whoever proves they're the real human (re-verification path)

Your answer:

### 17.10 Can revoked TRST be "un-revoked" if the originator wallet is later re-verified?
- **(a) No** — revocation is permanent for those tokens. If re-verified, new BRN starts fresh.
- (b) Yes — if the wallet is re-verified, previously revoked TRST becomes valid again

Your answer:

### 17.11 What if TRST expires between a send block and the corresponding receive block?
Alice sends TRST to Bob, but Bob doesn't publish a receive block before the TRST expires.
- **(a) Expired pending TRST is returned to sender** (auto-cancel after expiry)
- (b) Expired pending TRST is destroyed (nobody gets it)
- (c) Bob can still receive it (expiry only matters for further transfers, not for receiving)

Your answer:

### 17.12 TRST origin tracking for merged tokens
When tokens from different origins are merged, the merged token needs to track all origins for proportional revocation. How?
- **(a) Origin proportions map** — merged token stores `{origin_hash: proportion}` for each constituent origin
- (b) Pointer to merge transaction — the merge tx itself lists the inputs, so just follow the chain
- (c) Both (redundant but faster lookups)

Your answer:

---

## 18. BRN Edge Cases

### 18.1 Can you have outstanding BRN staked AND burn BRN at the same time?
Example: Alice has 100 BRN, stakes 20 for verification. Can she burn the remaining 80?
- **(a) Yes** — available BRN = accrued - burned - staked. You can burn anything not staked.
- (b) No — staking locks the entire wallet from burns until the stake resolves

Your answer:

### 18.2 Is there a maximum BRN balance?
- **(a) No cap** — BRN accrues indefinitely (u128 is large enough for millennia)
- (b) Cap at some amount (stops accruing once reached)
- (c) Governance-configurable cap

Your answer:

### 18.3 BRN rate change history — how many changes to store per wallet?
Each rate change creates a new accrual segment. Over decades, this could grow.
- **(a) Store all rate changes globally** (not per-wallet — all wallets use the same rate history)
- (b) Store per-wallet (allows different rates per wallet — but this contradicts "equal for everyone")

Your answer:

### 18.4 BRN staking lock period
How long is BRN staked for during verification voting?
- **(a) Until the verification process completes** (vote → outcome → stakes returned/forfeited)
- (b) Fixed time period (e.g., 7 days)
- (c) Until the cooldown after verification completes

Your answer:

### 18.5 Can staked BRN be used for other stakes simultaneously?
Alice stakes 20 BRN for verifying Bob. While that stake is active, can she stake another 20 BRN for verifying Charlie?
- **(a) Yes** — multiple concurrent stakes allowed, as long as total staked ≤ available BRN
- (b) No — one active stake at a time

Your answer:

---

## 19. Verification Deep Dive

### 19.1 How does a wallet opt in to be a verifier?
- **(a) Special "opt-in" transaction** on the DAG (publishable, revocable)
- (b) Configuration flag in wallet software (not on-chain)
- (c) Any wallet with sufficient BRN is automatically eligible

Your answer:

### 19.2 Minimum requirements to be a verifier
- **(a) Must be verified for at least X days** (e.g., 30 days) and have minimum BRN balance
- (b) Any verified wallet can verify
- (c) Must have successfully voted in at least N previous verifications

Your answer:

If (a), what minimum age? **30 days**
If (a), what minimum BRN balance? **50 BRN**

Your answer:

### 19.3 Minimum requirements to be an endorser
- **(a) Any verified wallet** can endorse (they just need enough BRN to burn)
- (b) Must be verified for a minimum period
- (c) Must not have endorsed a wallet that was later revoked (reputation requirement)

Your answer:

### 19.4 MVP verification evidence — what's the concrete first method?
The whitepaper says modular. But for the first implementation, what do verifiers actually look at?
- (a) Video call with the wallet holder (Proof of Humanity style)
- (b) Social media attestation (link wallet to unique social accounts)
- **(c) Out-of-scope for protocol code** — the protocol just tracks endorsements and votes. How verifiers assess evidence is an off-chain/application concern.
- (d) Simple challenge-response (prove you control the wallet)
- (e) Other:

Your answer:

### 19.5 Verification timeout
How long do verifiers have to cast their votes once selected?
- **(a) 7 days** (1 week)
- (b) 3 days
- (c) 14 days
- (d) Configurable:

Your answer:

### 19.6 Do wallets need periodic re-verification?
- **(a) No** — verified once, verified forever (unless challenged)
- (b) Yes — must re-verify every X months/years
- (c) Configurable via governance

Your answer:

### 19.7 Can you endorse multiple wallets simultaneously?
- **(a) Yes** — no limit (each endorsement is an independent BRN burn)
- (b) Limited to N active endorsements at a time

Your answer:

### 19.8 Can you be a verifier while your own wallet is being challenged?
- (a) Yes — innocent until proven guilty
- **(b) No** — suspended from verifier pool while under challenge
- (c) Yes, but with reduced weight/trust

Your answer:

### 19.9 What happens to endorsers if the wallet they endorsed is later revoked?
The whitepaper says they lose their burned BRN (already gone). But:
- **(a) No additional penalty** — the BRN burn was the cost, that's it
- (b) Reputation hit — tracked and affects their eligibility to endorse in the future
- (c) Additional BRN penalty

Your answer:

### 19.10 Can a verifier see who endorsed the wallet they're verifying?
- **(a) Yes** — endorsement transactions are public on the DAG
- (b) No — endorser identities are hidden from verifiers to prevent collusion

Your answer:

---

## 20. Governance Deep Dive

### 20.1 Can proposals be withdrawn by the proposer?
- **(a) Yes** — during the Proposal phase only (before voting starts)
- (b) No — once submitted, it goes through the full process
- (c) Yes, at any phase (but endorsers don't get BRN back)

Your answer:

### 20.2 Can you change your vote after casting?
- **(a) No** — votes are final once cast
- (b) Yes — can change until the voting period ends
- (c) Yes, but changing costs additional BRN

Your answer:

### 20.3 What happens if quorum isn't met?
- **(a) Proposal fails** — treated as rejected, must be resubmitted
- (b) Voting period extends (e.g., by 1 week)
- (c) Quorum requirement is waived after extended period

Your answer:

### 20.4 Can multiple proposals be active simultaneously?
- **(a) Yes** — multiple proposals can be in different phases at the same time
- (b) No — only one active proposal at a time (prevents conflicting changes)
- (c) Yes, but conflicting proposals (changing the same parameter) are mutually exclusive

Your answer:

### 20.5 Can a delegate re-delegate to someone else?
- **(a) No** — delegation is direct only (A→B, but B can't delegate A's vote to C)
- (b) Yes — transitive delegation (liquid democracy)

Your answer:

### 20.6 Delegation scope
- **(a) Blanket delegation** — delegate votes on all proposals
- (b) Per-proposal delegation — choose delegate per proposal
- (c) Per-parameter-category delegation — delegate economic decisions to X, verification decisions to Y

Your answer:

### 20.7 Can the same parameter be changed by multiple proposals in quick succession?
Example: Proposal A changes BRN rate from 1 to 2. Before A activates, Proposal B changes BRN rate from 1 to 3.
- **(a) Last one wins** — if B activates after A, the rate becomes 3 regardless of A
- (b) Proposals reference the current value — B is invalid because it references rate=1 which A already changed
- (c) Queue — proposals for the same parameter are processed sequentially

Your answer:

## 21. Consti Deep Dive

### 21.1 Maximum amendment text length?

- (b) Empty — community writes it from scratch
- (c) A comprehensive document written by the creator

Your answer:

### 21.3 Amendment format
- **(a) Full text replacement** — each amendment is a complete new version of the affected section
- (b) Diff-based — amendments specify additions/removals to existing text
- (c) Append-only — amendments are added as new sections, old text is never modified

Your answer:

### 21.4 Can amendments reference or modify other amendments?
- **(a) Yes** — an amendment can repeal or modify a previous amendment
- (b) No — amendments are independent
- (c) Only repeal (can remove, but not modify)

Your answer:

### 22.1 Maximum peer connections?
- **(a) 64** peers (similar to Nano)
- (b) 128 peers
- (c) Configurable

Your answer:

### 22.2 Peer scoring and banning
- **(a) Score-based** — peers lose score for misbehavior (sending invalid blocks, spam), banned at threshold
- (b) Binary — peers are either trusted or banned
- (c) No peer scoring in MVP

Your answer:

### 22.3 Bootstrap nodes
How does a new node find peers?
- **(a) Hardcoded initial peer list** (DNS seeds or IP addresses) in the code, configurable in config
- (b) DHT only (Kademlia) — no hardcoded peers
- (c) Both — hardcoded seeds + DHT discovery

Your answer:

### 22.4 Clock synchronization tolerance
How many seconds of clock drift between nodes before a block's timestamp is rejected?
- **(a) 60 seconds** (1 minute)
- (b) 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- (c) 10 seconds
- (d) Configurable

Your answer:

### 22.5 NAT traversal
- (a) Required for MVP (use libp2p's hole-punching)
- **(b) Not required for MVP** — assume nodes have public IPs or manual port forwarding
- (c) Use relay nodes as fallback

Your answer:

### 22.6 Transaction propagation strategy
How are new blocks/transactions spread across the network?
- **(a) Gossipsub** (pubsub — each node gossips to a subset of peers, epidemic spread)
- (b) Flood (send to all connected peers)
- (c) Directed propagation (send to representatives only, they fan out)

Your answer:

### 22.7 Block propagation priority
When the network is congested, which blocks get propagated first?
- **(a) Higher PoW difficulty first** (like Nano — incentivizes more PoW for priority)
- (b) FIFO (first come, first served)
- (c) Account balance weighted (higher-balance accounts get priority)

Your answer:

---

## 23. Ledger Deep Dive

### 23.1 Epoch blocks for protocol upgrades?
Nano uses "epoch blocks" — special blocks signed by a designated account that upgrade all accounts to a new block format.
- **(a) Yes** — support epoch blocks for future-proofing protocol upgrades
- (b) No — handle upgrades via governance and node software updates only
- (c) Decide later

Your answer:

### 23.2 Can pruned history be recovered from peers?
- **(a) Yes** — nodes can request historical blocks from full (non-pruned) nodes
- (b) No — once pruned, gone forever for that node
- (c) Only from designated archival nodes

Your answer:

### 23.3 Maximum mempool/unchecked blocks size
How many unconfirmed blocks can a node hold in memory?
- **(a) 65,536 blocks** (64K)
- (b) Configurable
- (c) No limit (rely on PoW to prevent spam)

Your answer:

### 23.4 Account chain fork handling
If a node receives two blocks with the same `previous` hash (a fork):
- **(a) Start an election immediately** — use ORV to determine the winning block
- (b) Accept the first one seen, reject the second
- (c) Hold both until consensus resolves

Your answer:

### 23.5 Open block (first block in an account chain)
What triggers the creation of the first block?
- **(a) Receiving a pending send/burn** — the receive block IS the open block (like Nano)
- (b) Explicit "open" transaction type
- (c) Verification — the first block is created when the wallet is verified

Your answer:

---

## 24. Anti-Spam Deep Dive

### 24.1 PoW priority
Should higher PoW difficulty get faster processing?
- **(a) Yes** — like Nano, higher difficulty = higher priority in the processing queue
- (b) No — all valid PoW is treated equally

Your answer:

### 24.2 Pre-computed PoW
Can PoW be computed in advance (before the transaction is created)?
- **(a) Yes** — PoW is computed on the previous block hash, so it can be pre-cached for the next transaction
- (b) No — PoW must be computed on the new block hash

Your answer:

### 24.3 Rate limiting per account
Beyond PoW, should there be per-account rate limits?
- **(a) No** — PoW is sufficient anti-spam
- (b) Yes — maximum N transactions per account per second/minute
- (c) For new wallets only — spending limits for recently verified wallets (whitepaper mentions this)

Your answer:

If (c), what's the limit for new wallets? E.g., **max 10 transactions per day for first 30 days**

Your answer:

---

## 25. Wallet Deep Dive

### 25.1 Multiple accounts per wallet?
Nano wallets can derive multiple accounts from one seed.
- (a) Single account per wallet (1 seed = 1 address)
- **(b) Multiple accounts** (1 seed = many addresses via derivation path). Simpler key management.

Your answer:

### 25.2 Transaction history storage (client side)
- **(a) Full history** — wallet stores all transactions it's ever made
- (b) Pruned — only keep last N transactions locally (full history on-chain)
- (c) Configurable

Your answer:

### 25.3 Pending receive behavior
When TRST is sent to your wallet (two-phase model), should the wallet auto-accept?
- (a) Auto-accept everything (publish receive blocks automatically)
- **(b) Auto-accept by default, with configurable reject rules** (e.g., reject TRST from unknown origins, require group trust check)
- (c) Manual accept only

Your answer:

### 25.4 Wallet backup format
- **(a) Mnemonic phrase only** — wallet can be fully reconstructed from 24 words
- (b) Encrypted file backup
- (c) Both

Your answer:

---

## 26. Groups Deep Dive

### 26.1 Group registration — where does the directory live?
- **(a) Public list on IPFS/web** — any group can register by publishing their endpoint
- (b) On-chain registry (special transactions for registering groups)
- (c) Hardcoded initial list + community-maintained JSON file

Your answer:

### 26.2 Group query protocol
The wallet queries a group to check if a TRST originator is a member.
- **(a) Simple REST API**: `GET /verify/{wallet_address}` → `{"valid": bool, "score": float, "since": timestamp}`
- (b) More complex protocol (challenge-response, signed responses)
- (c) GraphQL

Your answer:

### 26.3 Group response caching
- **(a) Cache for 1 hour** — re-query after TTL expires
- (b) Cache for 24 hours
- (c) No caching — always query live
- (d) Configurable TTL

Your answer:

### 26.4 What if a trusted group goes offline?
- **(a) Fallback to protocol-level verification only** (accept TRST if originator is protocol-verified)
- (b) Reject TRST from that group's members until group is back online
- (c) Use cached responses until they expire

Your answer:

### 26.5 Group trust policy defaults
When a new wallet is set up, what's the default trust policy?
- **(a) Accept all** — trust protocol-level verification only (no group checking)
- (b) Require at least one group endorsement
- (c) Configurable during wallet setup

Your answer:

---

## 27. Security Edge Cases

### 27.1 Double-endorsement prevention
Can the same endorser endorse the same wallet twice?
- **(a) No** — one endorsement per endorser per wallet
- (b) Yes — but each endorsement still costs BRN

Your answer:

### 27.2 Self-endorsement
Can a wallet endorse itself?
- **(a) No** — must be a different verified wallet
- (b) Yes (but it still costs BRN, so it's economically discouraged)

Your answer:

### 27.3 Endorser-verifier conflict of interest
Can someone who endorsed a wallet also be selected as a verifier for that same wallet?
- **(a) No** — endorsers are excluded from the verifier pool for that wallet
- (b) Yes — the VRF selection doesn't filter endorsers

Your answer:

### 27.4 Challenge spam prevention
What prevents someone from challenging every wallet they see?
- **(a) The stake itself** — challenging costs 50 BRN. If the challenge fails, they lose it. Economic deterrent.
- (b) Rate limit — max N challenges per wallet per time period
- (c) Both

Your answer:

### 27.5 Concurrent challenges on the same wallet
Can multiple people challenge the same wallet simultaneously?
- **(a) No** — only one active challenge per wallet at a time. Second challenger must wait.
- (b) Yes — multiple challenges can run in parallel (wastes resources but simpler)

Your answer:

### 27.6 Can you challenge the genesis wallet(s)?
- **(a) Yes** — genesis wallets are not special after the bootstrap phase. Same rules apply.
- (b) No — genesis wallets are permanently immune

Your answer:

---

## 28. Economic Edge Cases

### 28.1 What if BRN rate is voted to 0?
The whitepaper says r=0 means "normal money" (no UBI). This is valid. But:
- **(a) BRN accrual stops for everyone, but existing BRN remains and can still be burned**
- (b) BRN accrual stops AND existing BRN is frozen
- (c) Not allowed — minimum BRN rate enforced

Your answer:

### 28.2 What if TRST expiry is voted to 0?
The whitepaper says e=0 means "full communism" (TRST expires instantly). But practically:
- **(a) TRST becomes non-transferable immediately after minting** (only the original receiver can hold it, as expired)
- (b) Not allowed — minimum expiry enforced (e.g., 1 day)
- (c) Allowed but warning — governance can set it, community deals with consequences

Your answer:

### 28.3 What if TRST expiry is voted to infinity?
- **(a) TRST never expires** — equivalent to "normal money." Valid configuration.
- (b) Maximum expiry enforced (e.g., 1000 years)

Your answer:

### 28.4 Pending TRST and expiry
Does TRST that's "pending" (sent but not yet received) count toward the sender's or receiver's balance for expiry purposes?
- **(a) Neither** — pending TRST is in limbo. Expiry clock still ticks based on origin timestamp.
- (b) Still counts as sender's until received

Your answer:

---

## 29. Node Operations

### 29.1 Graceful shutdown behavior
When a node shuts down:
- **(a) Flush all pending writes to LMDB, close peer connections, save state**
- (b) Just kill — LMDB is transaction-safe so no data loss

Your answer:

### 29.2 Node modes
Should the node support different operational modes?
- **(a) Full node** (default) — stores everything, participates in consensus
- **(b) Light node** — stores only own account chains, relies on full nodes for verification
- **(c) Archival node** — full node that never prunes
- Which to implement first? **Full node only for MVP**

Your answer (which modes, and which first):

### 29.3 RPC authentication
- **(a) No auth for MVP** — RPC is local-only by default (bind to 127.0.0.1)
- (b) API key authentication
- (c) Both — no auth for local, API key for remote

Your answer:

### 29.4 Telemetry / metrics
- **(a) Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint** (block count, peer count, confirmation time, etc.)
- (b) No metrics for MVP
- (c) Custom stats endpoint

Your answer:

---

## 30. Future-Proofing

### 30.1 Block version field
Should blocks have a version number for future format changes?
- **(a) Yes** — include a `version: u8` field in every block. Start at 1.
- (b) No — use epoch blocks for upgrades instead

Your answer:

### 30.2 Transaction extensibility
Should transactions have an "extensions" or "extra data" field for future use?
- **(a) Yes** — optional `extensions: Vec<u8>` field (empty for now, available for future protocol features)
- (b) No — keep blocks minimal, add new fields via version bumps

Your answer:

### 30.3 Signature scheme agility
Should the protocol support multiple signature algorithms (not just Ed25519)?
- **(a) Yes** — include a `sig_type: u8` field. Only Ed25519 (type 0) for now, but extensible.
- (b) No — Ed25519 only, change via hard fork if ever needed

Your answer:

---

## 31. Display & UX

### 31.1 Decimal places for display
Internally everything is u128 raw. How many decimal places when displaying to users?
- **(a) 18 decimals** (1 BRN = 10^18 raw, like ETH wei). Display "1.000000000000000000 BRN"
- (b) 8 decimals (like BTC satoshis). 1 BRN = 10^8 raw
- (c) 6 decimals (like USDC). 1 BRN = 10^6 raw
- (d) Other:

Your answer:

### 31.2 Display units — should there be named sub-units?
Bitcoin has BTC, mBTC, μBTC, satoshi. Should BURST have named sub-units?
- (a) No — just BRN and TRST, show decimals
- **(b) Yes** — define e.g. "raw" (smallest), "milli" (10^-3), etc.
- (c) Decide later — not important for protocol code

Your answer:

### 31.3 Negative balances — how to display "you can't afford this"
When a user tries to burn more BRN than they have available:
- **(a) Pre-validate and show error message** before creating the transaction
- (b) Let the transaction fail at validation and show the rejection reason

Your answer:

### 31.4 TRST age/freshness indicator
Should wallets show how "fresh" TRST is (time remaining until expiry)?
- **(a) Yes** — show a colored indicator (green = >75% lifetime, yellow = 25-75%, red = <25%)
- (b) Just show the expiry date, no color coding
- (c) Configurable

Your answer:

### 31.5 QR code format for addresses
- **(a) Just the address string** — `brst_abc123...`
- (b) URI format — `burst:brst_abc123?amount=100&label=Coffee`
- (c) Both — plain QR for address, URI QR for payment requests

Your answer:

### 31.6 URI scheme for payment requests
- **(a) `burst:`** — e.g., `burst:brst_abc123?amount=100`
- (b) `brst:` — e.g., `brst:brst_abc123?amount=100`
- (c) Other:

Your answer:

---

## 32. Transaction Memo & Metadata

### 32.1 Should transactions support an optional memo/message field?
- (a) No — keep transactions minimal, memos are off-chain
- **(b) Yes** — optional UTF-8 memo field, max 256 bytes
- (c) Yes — optional arbitrary data field, max 1024 bytes

Your answer:

### 32.2 If memos are supported, are they encrypted?
- **(a) Plaintext** — visible on the DAG (like Stellar memos)
- (b) Encrypted — only sender and receiver can read (adds complexity)
- (c) Optional encryption — sender chooses

Your answer:

### 32.3 Should blocks have a "subtype" field for richer categorization?
Beyond the main block_type (Send, Receive, etc.), should there be a subtype for application-level semantics?
- (a) No — block_type is sufficient
- **(b) Yes** — optional `subtype: u16` field. E.g., Send could have subtypes like "payment", "donation", "refund". Protocol ignores it, but apps can use it.

Your answer:

---

## 33. Error Handling & Recovery

### 33.1 What happens if LMDB gets corrupted?
- **(a) Detect on startup, refuse to start, log instructions for recovery** (e.g., re-sync from network)
- (b) Attempt automatic repair
- (c) Both — try repair, fall back to re-sync if repair fails

Your answer:

### 33.2 What if a node receives a block it can't validate yet (missing predecessor)?
- **(a) Hold in "unchecked" buffer** — retry when predecessor arrives, timeout after X minutes
- (b) Request predecessor from the sending peer immediately
- (c) Both — request predecessor AND hold in buffer

Your answer:

If (a) or (c), unchecked timeout? **15 minutes**

Your answer:

### 33.3 What if the node falls far behind the network (e.g., offline for weeks)?
- **(a) Bootstrap mode** — download a recent ledger snapshot from peers, then catch up with individual blocks
- (b) Replay all blocks from peers sequentially (slow but trustless)
- (c) Both — snapshot for fast sync (optional), full replay for maximum trust

Your answer:

### 33.4 What if PoW computation fails or takes too long?
- **(a) Timeout after 30 seconds**, return error to the caller
- (b) No timeout — keep trying indefinitely
- (c) Configurable timeout

Your answer:

### 33.5 Double-receive prevention
What if a node processes the same receive block twice (e.g., during bootstrap replay)?
- **(a) Idempotent** — if the block already exists, silently skip. Detected by checking block hash existence.
- (b) Return error on duplicate

Your answer:

---

## 34. Bootstrapping & Network Launch

### 34.1 Bootstrapping the very first verified wallets
The creator's wallet is genesis-verified. How do the first few users get verified when there aren't enough verifiers yet?
- **(a) Creator acts as sole verifier** for the first N wallets (e.g., first 50). After that, normal verification kicks in.
- (b) Reduced verification requirements during bootstrap (e.g., only 1 verifier needed instead of 7)
- (c) Trust-on-first-use — first N wallets are auto-verified by endorsement alone (no verifier step)
- (d) Other:

Your answer:

### 34.2 Bootstrap duration / exit criteria
When does the "bootstrap phase" end and normal rules apply?
- **(a) After N verified wallets exist** (e.g., 100 wallets)
- (b) After X time (e.g., 6 months)
- (c) Manual flag — creator publishes a "bootstrap complete" transaction
- (d) Gradual — requirements scale up as the network grows (e.g., need 1 verifier at 10 wallets, 3 at 50, 7 at 100+)

Your answer:

### 34.3 Testnet vs mainnet genesis
- **(a) Separate genesis blocks** — testnet has its own genesis, completely independent chain
- (b) Same genesis, different network ID byte
- (c) Testnet is just a flag in config, same code

Your answer:

### 34.4 Network identifier
How to distinguish testnet from mainnet at the protocol level?
- **(a) Network ID byte** in every message (e.g., 0x01 = mainnet, 0x02 = testnet, 0x03 = devnet)
- (b) Different address prefix (e.g., `brst_` for mainnet, `brst_test_` for testnet)
- (c) Both

Your answer:

### 34.5 Testnet TRST/BRN — accelerated parameters?
Should testnet have faster BRN accrual and shorter TRST expiry for testing?
- **(a) Yes** — e.g., 100x faster BRN accrual, 1-hour TRST expiry

- (c) Configurable per-network

Your answer:

---

## 35. Consensus Deep Dive

### 35.1 Election lifecycle states
Nano elections go through: passive → active → confirmed → cemented. Same for BURST?
- **(a) Same as Nano**: Passive (no conflict seen) → Active (fork detected, votes requested) → Confirmed (quorum reached) → Cemented (finalized, never rolled back)
- (b) Simplified: Unconfirmed → Confirmed → Cemented
- (c) Other:

Your answer:

### 35.2 Cementing policy
When is a confirmed block permanently cemented (can never be rolled back)?
- **(a) After 5 minutes of stable confirmation** (no competing forks)
- (b) Immediately upon confirmation
- (c) After N subsequent blocks are added to the account chain
- (d) Configurable

Your answer:

### 35.3 Vote-by-hash optimization
Nano nodes can request votes for specific block hashes rather than sending full blocks.
- **(a) Yes** — implement vote-by-hash for bandwidth efficiency

- (c) Add later as optimization

Your answer:

### 35.4 Representative weight recalculation frequency
How often should the node recalculate which representatives have how much weight?
- **(a) Every block** — recalculate on each ChangeRep or delegation change
- (b) Every N seconds (e.g., every 60 seconds)
- (c) On-demand — recalculate only when an election starts

Your answer:

### 35.5 Minimum representative weight to vote
Should there be a minimum weight threshold for a representative's vote to count?
- **(a) No minimum** — even a self-representative with 1 delegation counts
- (b) Minimum 0.1% of total online weight
- (c) Configurable

Your answer:

### 35.6 What counts as "online weight" for the quorum denominator?
- **(a) Representatives that have voted in the last 5 minutes** (like Nano's online weight sampling)

Your answer:

---

## 37. RPC API Design

### 37.1 RPC style
- (a) REST-like (HTTP verbs, resource URLs)
- **(b) JSON-RPC** (like Nano — POST to single endpoint with `action` field)
- (c) gRPC (Protobuf-based)
- (d) All of the above (JSON-RPC primary, REST wrapper, gRPC optional)

Your answer:

### 37.2 Pagination for list endpoints
When querying account history, pending blocks, etc.:
- **(a) Cursor-based pagination** — pass `cursor` and `count`
- (b) Offset-based — pass `offset` and `limit`
- (c) Head/tail only — `count` most recent, with optional `head` hash

Your answer:

### 37.3 Should RPC support batch requests?
- **(a) Yes** — accept array of requests, return array of responses
- (b) No — one request per HTTP call

Your answer:

### 37.4 RPC rate limiting
- **(a) No rate limiting for MVP** (local-only binding is sufficient protection)
- (b) Configurable rate limits per IP
- (c) Token bucket rate limiting

Your answer:

### 37.5 Which RPC methods are "dangerous" and should be restricted?
Some methods modify state (send, receive, burn) while others are read-only (account_info, block_info).
- **(a) Separate "safe" and "unsafe" methods** — unsafe methods can be disabled via config
- (b) All methods available, no distinction
- (c) Require additional auth for unsafe methods

Your answer:

---

## 38. WebSocket API Design

### 38.1 Subscription model
- **(a) Topic-based** — subscribe to topics like `confirmation`, `new_block`, `vote`, `verification`
- (b) Account-based — subscribe to specific accounts
- (c) Both — topic-based AND account-specific subscriptions

Your answer:

### 38.2 Should WebSocket support filtered subscriptions?
E.g., "notify me only about transactions involving account X" instead of all transactions.
- **(a) Yes** — filter by account, block type, minimum amount
- (b) No — clients filter locally
- (c) Basic filters only (account filter)

Your answer:

### 38.3 WebSocket reconnection
If a client disconnects and reconnects, can they get missed events?
- **(a) No** — events are fire-and-forget. Client must query RPC for missed events.
- (b) Yes — server buffers N events per subscription, replays on reconnect
- (c) Client sends "last_seen_id" on reconnect, server replays from there

Your answer:

---

## 39. Multi-Device & Concurrent Access

### 39.1 Can the same wallet be open on multiple devices simultaneously?
- **(a) Yes, but read-only on all but one** — only one device can sign transactions at a time
- (b) Yes, fully concurrent — devices must sync state (complex)
- (c) No — wallet file is locked, second device gets an error
- (d) Yes, but transactions from multiple devices may conflict (user's problem to manage)

Your answer:

### 39.2 Wallet state synchronization
If the wallet is used on device A, how does device B learn about the new transactions?
- **(a) Query the node** — device B refreshes its state from the network
- (b) Peer-to-peer sync between devices (encrypted channel)
- (c) Both

Your answer:

---

## 40. Offline Capabilities

### 40.1 Can transactions be created offline?
- **(a) Partially** — you can sign a transaction offline if you know your current frontier hash, but PoW and submission require connectivity
- (b) Fully — pre-compute PoW for known frontier, sign, then submit when online
- (c) No — must be connected to create transactions

Your answer:

### 40.2 Work delegation
Can PoW computation be delegated to another machine/service?
- **(a) Yes** — wallet sends the block hash to a "work server", receives nonce back (like Nano's work_generate RPC)
- (b) No — PoW must be computed locally

Your answer:

---

## 41. Indexing & Query Capabilities

### 41.1 Should the node maintain secondary indexes?
Beyond the primary block/account storage, should the node build indexes for efficient queries?
- **(a) Yes** — index by: account history (ordered), TRST by origin, TRST by expiry date, pending receives per account
- (b) Minimal — only account history index
- (c) No indexes — queries scan the raw data (slow but simpler)

Your answer:

### 41.2 TRST-by-origin index
Should you be able to efficiently query "all TRST tokens that originated from wallet X"?
- **(a) Yes** — essential for revocation (need to find all TRST to revoke when an origin is deemed sybil)
- (b) Build on-demand during revocation (slower but no persistent index)

Your answer:

### 41.3 TRST-by-expiry index
Should you be able to efficiently query "all TRST tokens expiring in the next N days"?
- **(a) Yes** — useful for wallets and for pruning
- (b) Not needed at node level — wallet software handles this locally

Your answer:

### 41.4 Block-by-timestamp range queries
Should you be able to query "all blocks between time T1 and T2"?
- **(a) Yes** — useful for block explorers and analytics
- (b) No — blocks are indexed by hash and account, not by time

Your answer:

---

## 42. Account Naming & Identity

### 42.1 On-chain aliases/naming system?
Should wallets be able to register human-readable names (like ENS on Ethereum)?
- (a) Yes — on-chain name registry
- **(b) No** — out of scope. Third-party naming services can build on top.
- (c) Reserve the capability (include a "register name" block type) but don't implement the registry yet

Your answer:

### 42.2 Address book
Should the wallet software support a local address book?
- **(a) Yes** — local-only, not on-chain. Map addresses to nicknames.
- (b) No — users manage contacts externally

Your answer:

## 43. Verifier Reputation & History

### 43.1 Should verifier accuracy be tracked?
- **(a) Yes** — track how often a verifier's vote aligned with the final outcome. Published on-chain.
- (b) Yes, but off-chain only (wallet software or explorer tracks it)
- (c) No — verifiers are anonymous and interchangeable

Your answer:

### 43.2 Does verifier reputation affect future selection?
- **(a) No** — VRF selection is purely random among eligible verifiers (reputation is informational only)
- (b) Yes — higher-reputation verifiers are weighted more heavily in selection
- (c) Yes — low-reputation verifiers are excluded from the pool

Your answer:

### 43.3 Verifier history storage
- **(a) On-chain** — each vote is a block on the verifier's account chain
- (b) Separate database — verifier stats stored in a dedicated LMDB table
- (c) Derived — computed from the DAG on demand (no separate storage)

Your answer:

## 44. Challenge System Deep Dive

### 44.1 Challenge evidence submission
When someone challenges a wallet, do they need to provide evidence?
- **(a) No** — the stake IS the commitment. The challenge triggers re-verification where new verifiers assess independently.
- (b) Yes — challenger must submit evidence (links, screenshots, etc.) that verifiers review
- (c) Optional — evidence can be attached but isn't required

Your answer:

### 44.2 Challenge outcome notification
How are affected parties notified of challenge results?
- **(a) On-chain** — the outcome is a block (or special transaction) visible to all
- (b) WebSocket notification to subscribed wallets
- (c) Both

Your answer:

### 44.3 What happens to pending transactions during a challenge?
If wallet X is being challenged, can X still send/receive?
- **(a) Yes** — innocent until proven guilty. All operations continue normally.
- (b) Sends are frozen, receives still work
- (c) Everything is frozen until challenge resolves

Your answer:

### 44.4 Challenge resolution verifiers — same pool or different?
Are the verifiers for a challenge selected from the same pool as original verification?
- **(a) Same pool** — any eligible verifier, but excluding the original verifiers for that wallet
- (b) Same pool, including original verifiers (they might have new information)
- (c) Special "appeals" pool of more experienced verifiers

Your answer:

### 44.5 Revocation propagation speed
When a wallet is revoked, how quickly must all nodes invalidate the affected TRST?
- **(a) Immediately** — revocation is treated as a high-priority consensus message
- (b) Best-effort — propagates like a normal block (sub-second in practice)
- (c) Within N seconds (configurable SLA)

Your answer:

---

## 45. Endorsement Deep Dive

### 45.1 Do endorsements expire?
Once Alice endorses Bob (burning BRN), does that endorsement count forever?
- **(a) Yes, forever** — the burned BRN is gone. The endorsement is a permanent record on the DAG.
- (b) No — endorsements expire after X months. Must be re-endorsed periodically.

Your answer:

### 45.2 Can an endorsement be revoked by the endorser?
Alice endorsed Bob. Later Alice thinks Bob might be a sybil. Can she "un-endorse"?
- **(a) No** — endorsements are permanent. Alice already burned the BRN. She can challenge Bob instead.
- (b) Yes — publish a "revoke endorsement" block. Doesn't refund BRN but removes the endorsement count.

Your answer:

### 45.3 Endorsement ordering
Must endorsements reach the threshold before verifiers are selected, or can they happen concurrently?
- **(a) Sequential** — all required endorsements must be confirmed before VRF selects verifiers
- (b) Concurrent — endorsements and verifier selection happen in parallel (faster but more complex)

Your answer:

---

## 46. Snapshot & Fast Sync

### 46.1 Should the node support ledger snapshots for fast syncing new nodes?
- **(a) Yes** — periodically create a snapshot (state at block height N), new nodes download snapshot + replay blocks after N
- (b) No — always full replay from genesis (trustless but very slow for mature networks)
- (c) Defer to post-MVP

Your answer:

### 46.2 Snapshot trust model
If snapshots are supported, how does a new node trust the snapshot?
- **(a) Snapshot hash signed by a quorum of representatives** (same trust model as consensus)
- (b) Snapshot provided by a trusted hardcoded source (less decentralized)
- (c) Node validates snapshot against block hashes (verify Merkle root)

Your answer:

### 46.3 Snapshot frequency
- **(a) Every 10,000 blocks** (approximate, per-account chains make this tricky — maybe every N hours instead)
- (b) Every 24 hours
- (c) On-demand only (operator triggers snapshot creation)

Your answer:

---

## 47. Revocation Mechanics

### 47.1 Revocation scope — which TRST is revoked?
When wallet X is revoked (proven sybil):
- **(a) All TRST ever minted by X** — every token where X is the origin, regardless of current holder
- (b) Only TRST currently held by X
- (c) All TRST minted by X that hasn't been "spent" by an honest party yet (partial — harder to implement)

Your answer:

### 47.2 Revocation of merged TRST
If TRST from origin X was merged with TRST from origin Y, and X is revoked:
- **(a) Proportional reduction** — the merged token's value is reduced by X's proportion. E.g., if merged token was 60% X + 40% Y, holder loses 60%.
- (b) Entire merged token is revoked (harsh but simpler)
- (c) Split the merged token — the X portion is revoked, the Y portion becomes a new token

Your answer:

### 47.3 Revocation notification to holders
When TRST in your wallet is revoked:
- **(a) Automatic notification** — the wallet detects the revocation and shows a message: "X TRST was revoked because origin wallet Z was deemed sybil"
- (b) Silent — the balance just decreases, user must investigate why
- (c) Both — balance decreases + notification

Your answer:

### 47.4 Revocation finality
Can a revocation be reversed (e.g., if the challenge outcome was wrong)?
- **(a) No** — revocation is final. The wallet can re-verify and start earning fresh BRN.
- (b) Yes — through a governance proposal or special "appeal" process
- (c) Only if a meta-challenge is filed (challenge the challenge outcome)

Your answer:

---

## 48. BRN Computation Caching

### 48.1 Should BRN balance be cached or always computed on-the-fly?
BRN = rate × (now - verified_at) - burned - staked. This is a function of time, so it changes every second.
- **(a) Compute on read** — no caching, calculate from (verified_at, rate_history, burned, staked) each time
- (b) Cache with TTL — recompute every N seconds
- (c) Cache the "last computed" balance and time, then add the delta

Your answer:

### 48.2 BRN balance in RPC responses
When the RPC returns account info, should it include the current BRN balance?
- **(a) Yes** — compute and include it in the response (convenient for clients)
- (b) No — return the components (verified_at, rate, burned, staked) and let the client compute

Your answer:

---

## 49. Multi-Signature & Advanced Wallet Features

### 49.1 Multi-signature support
Should the protocol support multi-sig wallets (e.g., 2-of-3 signatures required)?
- **(a) Not for MVP** — add later as a protocol extension
- (b) Yes — include multi-sig as a block type from day one
- (c) Never — multi-sig is out of scope for a UBI protocol

Your answer:

### 49.2 Time-locked transactions
Should the protocol support transactions that can only be claimed after a certain time?
- **(a) Not for MVP**
- (b) Yes — include a `lock_until` timestamp field
- (c) Never needed

Your answer:

### 49.3 Conditional transactions (escrow)
Should the protocol support escrow or conditional transfers?
- **(a) Not for MVP**
- (b) Yes — escrow block type
- (c) Out of scope — use off-chain escrow services

Your answer:

---

## 50. Incentives & Game Theory

### 50.1 Why would someone run a representative node?
Nano relies on business incentives (merchants run nodes for fast confirmation). BURST's answer:
- **(a) Same as Nano** — altruism, business interest, philosophical alignment. No protocol-level incentive.
- (b) Representatives earn a small TRST reward per vote
- (c) Representatives earn "reputation" that's publicly visible (social incentive)
- (d) Other:

Your answer:

### 50.2 Why would someone run a full node (non-representative)?
- **(a) Self-sovereignty** — verify your own transactions without trusting others. No protocol reward.
- (b) Protocol reward for hosting/relaying blocks
- (c) Same as representative — altruism and business interest

Your answer:

### 50.3 Verifier compensation
Verifiers stake BRN and do work (reviewing evidence). What do they get?
- **(a) Return of their stake + proportional share of the challenger's forfeited stake** (if challenge fails) or proportional share of revoked TRST (if challenge succeeds)
- (b) Fixed TRST reward per verification completed
- (c) No compensation — the stake return is the "reward" (altruistic model)
- (d) Governance-configurable reward

Your answer:

### 50.4 Endorser motivation
Endorsers burn BRN permanently. Why would they do it?
- **(a) Social obligation** — you vouch for real people you know. No protocol reward. The system only works if people endorse.
- (b) Endorsers get a small TRST kickback when the person they endorsed earns TRST
- (c) Endorser's own TRST is weighted higher if they have endorsed others (reputation bonus)

Your answer:

---

## 51. Privacy Considerations

### 51.1 Are account balances public?
- **(a) Yes** — fully transparent, like Nano. Anyone can see any wallet's TRST and BRN.
- (b) Hidden — only the account owner can see their balance
- (c) Partially — TRST amounts in transactions are visible, but total balance requires summing the chain

Your answer:

### 51.2 Is the endorsement/verification graph public?
- **(a) Yes** — anyone can see who endorsed whom and which verifiers voted on which wallet. Full transparency.
- (b) Partially — endorsements are public but verifier identities are hidden
- (c) Fully private — only the verified wallet knows who verified them

Your answer:

### 51.3 Can a wallet's full transaction history be enumerated by anyone?
- **(a) Yes** — each account chain is a public linked list. Anyone can walk it from the frontier back to genesis.
- (b) No — implement some form of chain obfuscation

Your answer:

### 51.4 IP address privacy
- **(a) No privacy at the network layer for MVP** — peers see each other's IP. Users who want privacy can use Tor/VPN.
- (b) Built-in Tor support
- (c) Dandelion++ protocol for transaction origin hiding (like Monero)

Your answer:

---

## 52. Governance Meta-Questions

### 52.1 Can governance change the governance rules themselves?
E.g., can a proposal change the supermajority threshold for future proposals?
- **(a) Yes** — but with the HIGHEST supermajority threshold (e.g., 95%). This is "meta-governance."
- (b) No — governance rules are hardcoded and can only change via hard fork
- (c) Yes, with the same thresholds as any other proposal

Your answer:

### 52.2 Emergency governance
What if a critical bug is discovered that needs an immediate parameter change?
- **(a) No emergency mechanism** — go through normal governance. If it's truly urgent, node operators can coordinate an out-of-band hard fork.
- (b) Emergency proposal type — reduced voting period (e.g., 24 hours), higher quorum
- (c) Creator/foundation has emergency override power (centralized but practical during early phase)

Your answer:

### 52.3 Governance participation incentive
Is there a reward for voting on governance proposals?
- **(a) No** — voting is a civic duty, no reward
- (b) Small BRN boost for participating (e.g., 1% accrual bonus for active voters)
- (c) Penalty for NOT voting (e.g., reduced BRN accrual for inactive wallets)

Your answer:

---

## 53. Sybil Detection Heuristics

### 53.1 Should the protocol include automated sybil detection?
Beyond human verification, should nodes flag suspicious patterns?
- **(a) Not at the protocol level** — sybil detection is the job of verifiers (human judgment). Protocol is neutral.
- (b) Yes — flag accounts that show patterns like: same IP, similar transaction timing, circular TRST flows
- (c) Optional analytics module — not consensus-affecting, just informational

Your answer:

### 53.2 Circular flow detection
Should the node detect and flag circular TRST transfers (A→B→C→A)?
- **(a) No** — circular flows are not inherently fraudulent. Legitimate commerce can create loops.
- (b) Yes — flag but don't prevent. Informational only.
- (c) Prevent — reject transactions that would create a cycle (too restrictive)

Your answer:

---

## 54. Logging & Debugging

### 54.1 Structured logging format
- **(a) JSON structured logs** — machine-parseable, compatible with log aggregators (ELK, Loki)
- (b) Human-readable text logs (with optional JSON mode)
- (c) Both — configurable

Your answer:

### 54.2 Should the node expose a debug RPC?
Special RPC methods for debugging (dump internal state, trigger manual election, etc.):
- **(a) Yes, but only when compiled in debug mode** (`#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`)
- (b) Yes, always available but behind a config flag
- (c) No — use logging only

Your answer:

### 54.3 Block processing trace
Should the node support detailed tracing of how a specific block was processed?
- **(a) Yes** — tracing spans for: receive, validate, process, write, broadcast. Compatible with OpenTelemetry.
- (b) Logging only — detailed log lines at TRACE level
- (c) Not for MVP

Your answer:

---

## 55. Migration & Upgrade Path

### 55.1 Database migration strategy
When a new version changes the database schema:
- **(a) Versioned migrations** — store schema version in `meta` table, run migration code on startup if version mismatch
- (b) Re-sync from network — drop old database, re-download everything (simple but slow)
- (c) Both — try migration, fall back to re-sync if migration fails

Your answer:

### 55.2 Protocol versioning
How to handle nodes running different protocol versions?
- **(a) Handshake includes protocol version** — nodes with incompatible versions disconnect. Compatible versions (minor differences) can still communicate.
- (b) All nodes must run the same version (enforced by message format)
- (c) Backward compatibility — new nodes understand old messages, old nodes reject new message types

Your answer:

### 55.3 Hard fork coordination
If a hard fork is needed (incompatible protocol change):
- **(a) Governance-coordinated** — governance votes on activation block height/date. Nodes update before deadline.
- (b) Flag-day — announce a date, nodes must update by then
- (c) Miner/representative signaling — representatives signal readiness, activation at threshold

Your answer:

---

## 56. Cryptographic Details

### 56.1 BIP44 coin type number
Every cryptocurrency registers a coin type for HD wallet derivation (BIP44 path: `m/44'/coin_type'/account'/change/index`). Bitcoin is 0, Ethereum is 60, Nano is 165.
- **(a) Use an unregistered high number for now** (e.g., `m/44'/9999'/0'/0/0`) — register officially later via SLIP-0044
- (b) Use Nano's coin type (165) since we're DAG-inspired
- (c) Pick a specific number now:

Your answer:

### 56.2 Seed entropy
- **(a) 256 bits** (24-word mnemonic, BIP39 standard)

- (b) Separate checksum bytes appended
- (c) Blake2b of the public key, take first 5 bytes as checksum, encode as part of the address

Your answer:

### 56.5 Signature malleability protection
Ed25519 signatures can be malleable (same message, different valid signatures). Should the protocol canonicalize signatures?
- **(a) Yes** — reject non-canonical signatures (check that S < L, where L is the group order). Standard in modern Ed25519 implementations.
- (b) No — accept any valid signature

Your answer:

### 56.6 Hash of which fields constitutes the block hash?
- **(a) All fields except signature and work** — hash the "signable" portion of the block. Signature signs this hash. Work is computed on this hash.
- (b) All fields except work only — signature IS part of the hash
- (c) All fields — work and signature included in the hash

Your answer:

---

## 57. Block Size & Limits

### 57.1 Maximum block size in bytes?
- **(a) 1 KB** (1024 bytes) — sufficient for all standard block types. Limits abuse.
- (b) 4 KB — more room for extensions/memos
- (c) No hard limit (rely on PoW for anti-spam)
- (d) Other:

Your answer:

### 57.2 Maximum pending receives per account
Should there be a limit on how many unclaimed pending sends can target one account?
- **(a) No limit** — PoW prevents spam
- (b) 1,000 pending receives max — reject sends to accounts with full pending queues
- (c) 10,000
- (d) Configurable

Your answer:

### 57.3 Pending receive timeout
How long can a send sit unclaimed before it's returned to the sender?
- **(a) No timeout** — pending forever until the receiver claims it or it expires (TRST expiry handles the economic case)
- (b) 30 days — auto-return after that
- (c) Configurable

Your answer:

### 57.4 Maximum account chain depth
Is there a limit on how many blocks a single account chain can have?
- **(a) No limit** — chains grow indefinitely
- (b) Limit (e.g., 1 million blocks per account)
- (c) No limit but prunable — old blocks can be pruned if the node is in pruning mode

Your answer:

---

## 58. Threading & Concurrency

### 58.1 Thread pool sizing
- **(a) Auto-detect** — use `num_cpus` crate, scale thread pools to available cores
- (b) Fixed — hardcoded thread counts (e.g., 4 workers)
- (c) Configurable in node config

Your answer:

### 58.2 Async runtime
- **(a) Tokio** — industry standard for async Rust
- (b) async-std
- (c) Synchronous only (no async) — simpler but limits concurrency

Your answer:

### 58.3 Block processing concurrency
Can multiple blocks from different accounts be processed in parallel?
- **(a) Yes** — blocks on different account chains are independent. Parallel processing with per-account locks.
- (b) No — sequential processing (simpler but slower)

Your answer:

How many double-spend elections can run simultaneously?
- **(a) 500** (similar to Nano)
- (b) 100
- (c) Configurable
- (d) No limit

Your answer:

---

## 59. Network Protocol Details

- (b) Simple version exchange only
- (c) Full TLS handshake (encrypted channel)

Your answer:

### 59.2 Keepalive interval
- **(a) Every 60 seconds** — send a keepalive message with a list of known peers
- (b) Every 30 seconds
- (c) Every 120 seconds
- (d) Configurable

Your answer:

### 59.3 Peer exchange
Should keepalive messages include peer addresses (so nodes discover new peers)?
- **(a) Yes** — include up to 8 random peers per keepalive (like Nano)
- (b) No — use DHT only for peer discovery
- (c) Both — peer exchange AND DHT

Your answer:

### 59.4 Message deduplication
How to avoid processing the same block/vote message twice?
- **(a) Hash-based dedup** — maintain a rolling set of recently-seen message hashes (e.g., last 65536). Skip if already seen.

- (b) No — trust peers (they're scored and banned if abusive)
- (c) Configurable

Your answer:

### 59.7 Connection encryption
- **(a) No encryption for MVP** — messages are public anyway (blocks, votes). Focus on authentication via node ID signatures.
- (b) TLS/Noise protocol for all peer connections
- (c) Optional — configurable

Your answer:

---

## 60. Confirmation & Cementing Details

### 60.1 Confirmation height tracking
Nano tracks a "confirmation height" per account (the height below which all blocks are cemented). Same?
- **(a) Yes** — store `confirmation_height` per account. Background processor cements blocks in order.
- (b) No — cement individual blocks (track per-block confirmation status)

Your answer:

### 60.2 Confirmation height processor
A background task that processes confirmations in causal order (if A depends on B, confirm B first):
- **(a) Yes** — dedicated background thread, processes in topological order. Bounded to 65536 pending confirmations.
- (b) Inline — confirm as part of block processing (simpler but blocks the pipeline)

Your answer:

### 60.3 Election timeout
If an election doesn't reach quorum within a time limit:
- **(a) 5 minutes** — election expires, can be restarted on next fork observation
- (b) 1 minute
- (c) 15 minutes
- (d) No timeout — elections run until resolved

Your answer:

### 60.4 Vote replay protection
Can old votes be replayed to influence new elections?

- (b) Votes include a timestamp — reject votes older than X
- (c) Sequence number per representative — each new vote has a higher sequence number

Your answer:

---

## 61. Work (PoW) Details

### 61.1 Different difficulty for different block types?
Should some block types require more PoW than others?
- **(a) Same difficulty for all** — simpler
- (b) Higher difficulty for send/burn (state-changing), lower for receive (just accepting)
- (c) Higher for first block (open), normal for subsequent

Your answer:

### 61.2 Work version
Should PoW have a version field for future algorithm changes?
- **(a) Yes** — `work_version: u8`. Version 1 = Blake2b. Future versions can use different algorithms.
- (b) No — change via epoch blocks

Your answer:

### 61.3 Work server protocol
If work delegation is supported (question 40.2), what's the protocol?
- **(a) RPC method** — `work_generate(block_hash, difficulty)` returns `{work: nonce}`. Same as Nano.
- (b) Separate protocol
- (c) Decide when implementing work delegation

Your answer:

---

## 62. Representative System Details

### 62.1 Can any wallet be a representative, or must they opt in?
- **(a) Any wallet** — if someone sets you as their representative, you are one. No opt-in needed. (Like Nano)
- (b) Must opt in — publish a "register as representative" block

Your answer:

### 62.2 Representative change cooldown
Can you change your representative every block?
- **(a) No cooldown** — change rep as often as you want (like Nano). Each ChangeRep is just a block.
- (b) Cooldown — max 1 rep change per 24 hours
- (c) Configurable

Your answer:

### 62.3 What if your representative goes offline?
- **(a) Nothing** — your weight simply doesn't vote until you change rep or they come back. The "online weight" denominator excludes them.
- (b) Auto-fallback to a secondary representative
- (c) Wallet prompts user to change representative

Your answer:

### 62.4 Principal representative threshold
Nano distinguishes "principal representatives" (>0.1% of online weight) who actively vote, from small reps who are silent. Same?
- **(a) Yes** — only representatives above a minimum weight threshold (e.g., 0.1% of online weight) actively broadcast votes. Others are "passive."
- (b) No — all representatives vote (more decentralized but more network traffic)
- (c) Configurable threshold

Your answer:

---

## 63. Build & Distribution

### 63.1 Feature flags
Should the Rust workspace use Cargo feature flags for optional components?

- (b) No — compile everything always
- (c) Separate binaries — `burst-node`, `burst-wallet-cli`, `burst-rpc-server`

Your answer:

### 63.2 WASM compilation target
Should `wallet_core` and `crypto` compile to WebAssembly for browser/mobile use?
- **(a) Design for it** — avoid `std::fs`, `std::net` in wallet_core. Use `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]` where needed. Verify it compiles to WASM.
- (b) Not for MVP — desktop/server only
- (c) Never — native only

Your answer:

### 63.3 CLI interface for the daemon
- **(a) Subcommand-based CLI** — `burst-node start`, `burst-node status`, `burst-node wallet create`, etc. Use `clap` crate.
- (b) No CLI — daemon starts with a config file, interact via RPC only
- (c) Both — CLI for management, RPC for programmatic access

Your answer:

### 63.4 Docker support
- **(a) Provide a Dockerfile** — multi-stage build (build in rust image, run in slim image)

- (d) Defer to post-MVP

Your answer:

### 64.2 Testnet faucet
Should there be a faucet for the testnet (auto-verifies wallets, distributes test TRST)?
- **(a) Yes** — simple RPC endpoint that auto-verifies a wallet and sends it TRST. Testnet only.

- (c) Defer

Your answer:

### 64.3 Property-based testing
Should we use property-based testing (e.g., `proptest` crate) for critical invariants?

- (b) Not for MVP
- (c) Ad-hoc benchmarks only

Your answer:

---

## 65. Block Explorer & External Tooling

### 65.1 Is a block explorer in scope?
- **(a) Not for MVP** — third parties can build explorers using RPC/WebSocket
- (b) Basic built-in web UI (served by the node)
- (c) Separate project — build after core is stable

Your answer:

### 65.2 Should the RPC expose enough data for a block explorer?
- **(a) Yes** — ensure RPC has: account history, block details, pending list, representative info, verification status, network stats
- (b) Minimal — only what wallets need. Explorers need additional indexing.

Your answer:

### 65.3 GraphQL API
- **(a) Not for MVP** — JSON-RPC is sufficient
- (b) Yes — GraphQL alongside JSON-RPC for flexible queries
- (c) Instead of JSON-RPC (GraphQL as primary API)

Your answer:

## 67. Arithmetic & Overflow Edge Cases

### 67.1 BRN overflow protection
A verified wallet accruing 1 BRN/hour = 10^18 raw/hour. After 1 million years that's ~8.76 × 10^27 raw. u128 max is ~3.4 × 10^38, so safe. But should we add explicit overflow checks?
- **(a) Yes** — use `checked_mul` / `checked_add` everywhere. Return error on overflow.
- (b) No — rely on u128 being large enough (it is for any realistic timeframe)

Your answer:

### 67.2 Proportional split rounding
When revoking a merged token, proportional math may not divide evenly. E.g., 100 TRST that was 33.3% from origin A and 66.7% from origin B — revoke A → 33.3 TRST revoked. But raw amounts are integers.
- **(a) Round down for the revoked portion** — holder keeps any fractional remainder (1 raw rounding error in their favor)
- (b) Round up — protocol is strict, holder loses the fractional raw
- (c) Track proportions as exact fractions (numerator/denominator) to avoid rounding entirely

Your answer:

### 67.3 Timestamp representation
- **(a) u64 Unix seconds** — supports dates up to year 584 billion. More than enough.
- (b) i64 Unix seconds — supports dates before 1970 (not needed, but standard in some ecosystems)
- (c) u64 milliseconds — millisecond precision, supports dates up to year 584 million

Your answer:

### 67.4 Endianness for binary serialization
- **(a) Little-endian** — Rust's default, most hardware is LE
- (b) Big-endian (network byte order) — traditional for protocols
- (c) Let the serialization library decide (bincode uses LE by default)

## 68. Verification Tie-Breaking & Edge Cases

### 68.1 What if a verification vote exactly ties?
E.g., 7 verifiers: 3 Legitimate, 3 Sybil, 1 Neither. No side reaches 90%.
- **(a) Inconclusive** — trigger a revote with new verifiers (up to max revotes). If all revotes tie, default to rejected (not verified).
- (b) Tie goes to the wallet — verified
- (c) Tie goes against the wallet — rejected

Your answer:

### 68.2 What if ALL verifiers vote Neither?
- **(a) Same as inconclusive** — trigger revote. Verifiers may be penalized if this is excessive.
- (b) Wallet is rejected
- (c) Verification is cancelled — wallet must re-collect endorsements

Your answer:

### 68.3 What if a selected verifier never votes (goes offline)?
- **(a) Wait for timeout, then proceed with votes received** — quorum calculation uses votes cast, not verifiers selected
- (b) Replace the absent verifier with a new VRF selection
- (c) Extend the deadline once, then proceed without them

Your answer:

### 68.4 What if an endorser's wallet is revoked during an ongoing verification they endorsed?
Alice endorsed Bob. While Bob's verification is in progress, Alice gets revoked.
- **(a) Alice's endorsement is invalidated** — Bob may fall below the endorsement threshold, pausing verification until new endorsements arrive
- (b) Endorsement stands — it was valid when submitted, and the BRN was already burned
- (c) Verification is cancelled entirely

Your answer:

### 68.5 Circular endorsement prevention
Can Alice endorse Bob, and Bob endorse Alice?
- **(a) Allowed** — endorsements are just BRN burns. The verification process (independent verifiers) prevents collusion anyway.
- (b) Prohibited — detect and reject circular endorsements
- (c) Allowed but flagged — verifiers see a warning

## 69. Representative & Consensus Edge Cases

### 69.1 Equivocation detection
What if a representative votes for BOTH sides of a fork?
- **(a) Detect and penalize** — if a node receives conflicting votes from the same representative, broadcast the proof. Penalize by reducing their weight to 0 for X hours.
- (b) Detect but no penalty — just ignore the later vote
- (c) No detection — trust representatives to be honest

Your answer:

### 69.2 Network partition recovery
If the network splits into two partitions and they later reconnect:
- **(a) The partition with more online weight wins** — blocks confirmed in the minority partition may be rolled back (if not yet cemented)
- (b) No special handling — forks are resolved by normal ORV when the partitions reconnect
- (c) Freeze and wait for manual intervention

Your answer:

### 69.3 Minimum online weight for consensus to function
Below what threshold of online weight should consensus be considered non-functional?
- **(a) 60 million delegated weight units** (Nano uses this) — below this, elections don't confirm
- (b) Percentage-based — below 10% of total delegated weight, consensus pauses
- (c) No minimum — consensus works with whatever weight is online (risky for small networks)
- (d) Configurable — start with no minimum for MVP/testnet

Your answer:

### 69.4 What if there's only one representative?
During early bootstrap with very few nodes:
- **(a) Single rep = 100% of weight, can confirm alone** — acceptable during bootstrap
- (b) Minimum 3 representatives required for any confirmation
- (c) Bootstrap mode — relaxed requirements

## 70. Account Spam & Resource Exhaustion

### 70.1 Account creation spam
Creating accounts is free (just receive a pending send). Can someone create millions of empty accounts?
- **(a) PoW on the open/receive block is the deterrent** — each account creation requires PoW, which costs compute
- (b) Minimum opening balance — must receive at least X TRST to open an account
- (c) No protection needed — accounts are cheap in storage (tiny entries in LMDB)

Your answer:

### 70.2 Dust attack protection
Someone sends 1 raw (smallest unit) to millions of accounts, creating pending receives that clog wallets.
- **(a) PoW is sufficient** — each dust send requires PoW, making mass dust expensive
- (b) Minimum send amount (e.g., 1000 raw)
- (c) Wallet-side filtering — wallet ignores pending below a threshold
- (d) Both (a) and (c)

Your answer:

### 70.3 PoW stockpiling
Someone pre-computes PoW for thousands of blocks over weeks, then submits them all at once.
- **(a) PoW difficulty is per-block, not time-limited** — stockpiling is valid. The priority queue handles bursts (higher PoW = higher priority).
- (b) PoW must reference a recent timestamp — reject PoW computed more than X hours ago
- (c) Rate limiting per account prevents burst submission regardless of PoW stockpile

## 71. VRF Fallback & Failure

### 71.1 What if the drand network goes down?
Phase 1 depends on drand for randomness. If drand is unreachable:
- **(a) Queue all verifications** — wait for drand to come back. No verifier selection until randomness is available.
- (b) Fallback to local randomness (less secure but functional)
- (c) Fallback to the last known drand round — use it for all pending selections (reduced randomness quality)

Your answer:

### 71.2 Drand round mapping
How to map a verification request to a specific drand round?
- **(a) Use the next available drand round after the endorsement threshold is met** — deterministic and verifiable
- (b) Use a specific future round (e.g., "use round N+10" where N is current round)
- (c) Any round within a window (e.g., any round within 1 hour of endorsement completion)

## 72. Consti Text & Encoding

### 72.1 Constitution text encoding
- **(a) UTF-8** — standard, supports all languages
- (b) ASCII only
- (c) Markdown-formatted UTF-8

Your answer:

### 72.2 What about emoji in constitution amendments?
- **(a) Allowed** — UTF-8 includes emoji. People can put what they want.
- (b) Restricted to printable ASCII + common Unicode ranges (no emoji)

Your answer:

### 72.3 Amendment language
- **(a) No restriction** — any language. The community decides.
- (b) English only (for global consistency)
- (c) Multi-language — amendments must include English translation

Your answer:

### 72.4 Constitution versioning
- **(a) Sequential version numbers** — v1, v2, v3... Each amendment increments the version.
- (b) Hash-based — each version is identified by the hash of its content
- (c) Both — version number + content hash

Your answer:

---

## 73. Licensing & Legal

### 73.1 Open source license
- **(a) MIT** — permissive, maximum adoption
- (b) Apache 2.0 — permissive with patent protection
- (c) GPL v3 — copyleft, forces derivatives to be open source
- (d) Dual license — MIT + Apache 2.0 (like most Rust projects)

Your answer:

### 73.2 Is TRST legally a currency, commodity, security, or utility token?
This affects regulatory compliance. For the code:
- **(a) Build it as a general-purpose protocol** — no compliance features baked in. Legal classification is jurisdiction-dependent and not our problem.
- (b) Include optional compliance hooks (address blacklisting, transaction limits)
- (c) Include OFAC/sanctions checking capability (configurable)

## 74. Catastrophic Scenarios

### 74.1 What if Ed25519 is broken (quantum computing or cryptanalysis)?
- **(a) Signature scheme agility** (question 30.3) handles this — migrate to a post-quantum scheme via governance + epoch blocks
- (b) Emergency hard fork
- (c) The protocol is doomed (start over)

Your answer:

### 74.2 What if Blake2b is broken?
- **(a) Work version field** (question 61.2) + block version field (question 30.1) allow migrating to a new hash. All old blocks remain valid under old rules.
- (b) Emergency hard fork

Your answer:

### 74.3 What if >50% of verified wallets are sybils?
The verification system has been fundamentally compromised.
- **(a) Governance can vote to reset** — mass revocation + re-verification mandate. Painful but recoverable.
- (b) Emergency mechanism — creator/foundation can trigger mass re-verification
- (c) The protocol is doomed — game over, start a new chain

Your answer:

### 74.4 What if the creator's wallet private key is compromised?
- **(a) Creator wallet is not special after bootstrap** — same rules as everyone else. Compromised key means attacker can spend creator's TRST, but can't do anything special to the protocol.
- (b) Creator has special powers that should be revocable
